This is a Godot project meant to be a collection of utilitied or a small example game to help creators make something like a 2048 clone.

This library is intended to be used by an upcoming commerical game project that I'm creating, a top-down RPG sliding-character tile-based game. The library is placed here under an MIT license to be used in that project, and in anyone elses projects.
